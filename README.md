This repository contains the official website for Niruntara Preschool, designed with a clean and modern layout featuring consistent header, footer, fonts, and spacing. The site includes pages like Home, About, Programs, Admissions, Gallery, Parent Resources, and Contact. The contact page features a floating WhatsApp-style chatbot that allows users to type a message and open WhatsApp Web or App directly to contact the school. The website is fully responsive and mobile-friendly, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with all assets organized under static/assets/ for styles and scripts, and static/images/ for images. To run locally, clone the repository, navigate to the folder, and open index.html in a browser or use a live server. This project is for educational and personal use, and the WhatsApp number can be updated in contact.html as needed.
